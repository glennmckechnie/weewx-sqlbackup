# Report timing:

# You are strongly encouraged to use the report timing feature to limit this
# skin to the occasional, suitably sized (see sql_period) time span.
# Currently the default is 1 day, taken daily.
# Tweak to suit. Test the result.

# First time? Need a refresher? There's a html README file in the skins directory
# sqlbackup/sqlbackupREADME.html which can be found on your weewx web server.
